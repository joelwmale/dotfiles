# ðŸš€ Dotfiles

This is a collection of my personal dotfiles and a few scripts to quickly configure a mac the way I like it.

Be careful if you're running this on a mac already set up. It will change your settings and I can't guarantee you like MacOS the same way I do!

## âœ¨ Running

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:joelwmale/dotfiles.git
$ ./bootstrap
```
